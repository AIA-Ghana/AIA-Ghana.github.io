## Styling content

With the Kramdown Markdown parser that Jekyll uses, you can add CSS classes to your content (see this [blog post](https://digitaldrummerj.me/styling-jekyll-markdown/)). By sticking to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/) classes, you can easily style your content.

[Alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/):

{: .alert .alert-info}
Alert info message. This paragraph is styled by prepending it with `{: .alert .alert-info}`.

[Aligning images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/images/#aligning-images):

The image to below is styled with `{: .rounded .float-left}`. `.rounded` rounds the corners, `.float-left` moves it to the left, with the text wrapping around it. You can use `{: .clearfix}` on a paragraph to stop wrapping.
