I recently interviewed Derek K Degbedzui about opportunities and challenges facing the Data Science industry in Ghana.

And how his startup [Notitia ](https://notitia.site/)is addressing these issues.

#### **Hi Derek, could you tell us a bit about yourself ?**

#### **How did you get into data science ?**

When I started in data science, I had virtually no experience and I was stuck in a number of materials while studying for my master’s degree in Management Information Systems with no career prospects.

I struggled to break into the field for months and was just as frustrated as anybody else.

With a lot of hard work, persistence, and experimentation, I was finally able to prove those people wrong, crack the code, and land my first job in the field.

I developed my data science job search strategies over time and eventually became a known name in Data science in Ghana as one of the young people helping students particularly to find interest in Data science opportunities. Along the way mentored and guided hundreds of aspiring data scientists across all levels especially in our universities.

Once I made the transition into data science, I knew I had to share my knowledge to help others start do the same and even do better . It became my mission to help others succeed where I struggled. I worked with number of students on campuses through Ethical AI club and it’s been fantastic.

With both job seeker and hiring manager perspectives in mind, I worked tirelessly to distill my years of knowledge into the battle-tested Notitia intelligent platform . And since its inception in COVID-19 era in 2020, Notitia platform is positioned to helping aspiring data scientists from my homeland Ghana and the African continent at large to get jobs and develop faster on it.

I believe that it shouldn't be so difficult for curious, hardworking, committed people like you to find a job that you love, and that's why I started Notitia Intelligent Mentoring Program- so that you don't have to go through months or years of heartache like I did or others so that you can have an exciting, fulfilling career and live the life you’ve been dreaming of.
