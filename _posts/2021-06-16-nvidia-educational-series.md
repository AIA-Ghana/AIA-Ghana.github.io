Join us on Thursday on our first educational series partnered with NVIDIA’s Emerging Chapters Program at 3PM GMT. 

The first part of the meeting will be a presentation on our program overview, an intro to Nvidia Technologies/stacks and a quick intro to some applications. This training is open to all our community members who can attend. The next session of the program will be a networking session with just each community’s leadership team and presenters. Please confirm your participation in the networking session if you have not done so already.[](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en)
