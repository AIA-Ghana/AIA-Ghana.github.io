Join us this Thursday, July 15th at 3pm GMT for our July Education series on the topic  “Edge Computing - Jetson AI Fundamentals” hosted by NVIDIA.

Machine Learning is moving to the edge. Nvidia Jetson family of modules is powerful enough to process ML workloads such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, etc. locally. In this session, we will arm the developers with the Jetson fundamentals and help them get started with ML development on the devices.
